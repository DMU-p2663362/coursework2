<p class="p5">The Basement is a nightclub located in the centre of Leicester, and is a large open dancefloor, with music mostly consisting of current
pop music and dance tracks. What is unique about Basement is that it is open until 6am- much later than most other clubs in the city, and so
becomes very popular later on in the night around 3, which is when most other nightclubs close. However, before this, the nightclub is mostly empty, as most people are at the more
popular clubs, with the weekdays that the club is open being fairly empty regardless. </p>
