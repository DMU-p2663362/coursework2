<p class="p3"> Club Republic is one of the more upscale nightclubs in leicester, with two dancelfoors: one smaller side room,
and one larger venue, complete with a stage for live music performances, with notable performers including Central Cee, D-Block Europe,
and Drake performing there. The venue has a great atmoshphere to it during these live music performces, however, when there are no live performances on,
the venue has a tendncy to be a bit more quiet, and have less of an overall atmosphere, whilst being more expensive than other options in the city. </p>
